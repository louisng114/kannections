# <ruby>æ¼¢<rt>KAN</rt></ruby>nections

Kannection is a webapp that helps the user study [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) by using the structure of the popular New York Times game [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). Unlike Connections, games are not daily, instead, users are able to select a [JLPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test) level and generate a random board. The site also features an [achievement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_(video_games)) for logged in users.
